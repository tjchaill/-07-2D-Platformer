2D Platformer Project:

I decided to be much more ambitious for this project than previous ones, which is one reason why it is being turned in late. I wanted to use animated sprites, have actual pixelated tilemaps, music, and other "juicy" aspects to this game. I gave it an alternative scoring system based on deaths rather than coins or some other item. I added a title menu and a game over screen, with an option to start over. The one assignment stipulation I had trouble with was saving/loading: I would love to speak with you regarding this feature in the near future. 

I hope you will consider giving me the 2 points for interesting features. These include:
 - fireball (press tab)
 - enemy deaths
 - music
 - animated player and enemies
 - the use of tilemaps and parallax backgrounds
 - "portals" that move the player between scenes
 - opening menu
 - game over screen 
 
 Thank you!
 TC
